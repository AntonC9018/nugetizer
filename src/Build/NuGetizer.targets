NuGetizer.PackageMetadata.targets

WARNING:  DO NOT MODIFY this file unless you are knowledgeable about MSBuild and have
          created a backup copy.  Incorrect changes to this file will make it
          impossible to load or build your projects from the command-line or the IDE.

This file brings in the known package metadata properties as defaut metadata for 
the PackageMetadata item. This target is imported last in SDK-style projects, even 
after Directory.Build.targets, so that the common metadata can be overriden via 
properties basically anywhere.
