# NuGetizer 3000

For the original design and intended goals and features, check out the [spec](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/NuGetizer-3000).

## Why

I got sick of trying to modify the gazillion properties, weird item, property and target names and more from the built-in SDK Pack targets, and still never quite achieving the simple goals I had in mind. Also, the original clean and clear design from [NuGetizer](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetizer) never got traction or support from the NuGet team, so the weirdness kept evolving in ever more incomprehensible ways ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. 

So, on to forking and shipping for real the simplified, understandable way of packing your libraries.
